# Rule Creation Standards

All Cursor rules MUST:
1. Be located in the `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Use the `.mdc` file extension
3. Include the following frontmatter:
   - `description`: Clear explanation of the rule's purpose
   - `globs`: Array of file patterns the rule applies to
   - `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if rule should always be enforced
4. Include a content section with examples

## ✅ Good Example

```mdc

description: Enforces consistent import ordering in Python files
globs: ["**/*.py"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Python Import Ordering

Imports must be grouped and ordered as follows:
1. Standard library imports
2. Third-party imports
3. Local application imports

## Examples

✅ Good:
```python
import os
import sys

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from myapp.utils import helper
```

❌ Bad:
```python
from myapp.utils import helper
import numpy as np
import os
import pandas as pd
import sys
```
```

## ❌ Bad Example

```mdc
# Python Import Rules

This rule is for Python imports.
They should be ordered properly.

Example:
import os
import pandas
```

Problems with the bad example:
- Missing frontmatter
- No clear description
- No globs specified
- No alwaysApply setting
- Poor example formatting
- No clear good/bad examples
